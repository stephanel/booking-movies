## Frontend

For the frontend I have chosen to work using Angular and Angular Material.

### Tools

- Angular 11
- Angular Material
- Jest
- DevExtreme 20.2

### Run the application

Note: we assume your command prompt is pointing to `frontend` folder.

First, install the required packages using the following command:

```dotnetcli
npm install
```

Then, run the application:

```dotnetcli
npm start
```

### Run the tests

Enter the following command in a terminal:

```dotnetcli
npm test
```
